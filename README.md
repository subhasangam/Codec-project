Network Traffic Analyzer
Network Traffic Analyzer is a Python-based tool that analyzes network traffic captured in PCAP files. It provides valuable insights into the communication between different IP addresses, the distribution of network protocols, and potential port scanning activities. The application aims to aid network administrators and security experts in identifying network-related issues and security vulnerabilities.

Features
Analyze network traffic from PCAP files
Calculate total bandwidth used
Display protocol distribution
Identify top IP address communications
Detect potential port scanning activities
Future Enhancements
In the future, the Network Traffic Analyzer will include the following features:

Plotting graphs w.r.t IP
Calculating latency, packet loss, throughput, jitter, network utilization, and error rates
Installation
Clone the repository:

Navigate to the project directory: cd network-traffic-analyzer

Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To analyze a PCAP file, run the following command:

python Network_traffic_analyzer.py <path_to_pcap_file> <port_scan_threshold>

Replace <path_to_pcap_file> with the path to your PCAP file, and <port_scan_threshold> with the desired threshold for detecting port scanning activities.
